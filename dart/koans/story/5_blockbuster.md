# 5. Blockbuster

Both of you decide to go watch a movie. When your date asks which movies are currently showing, you whip out your phone and check. Then you them list out to your date.

## Steps

1. Create a class called `Movie` with a member variable called `_name` which represents the name of the movie.
2. Now create **named constructor** methods of the movies that you would like to watch.
3. Override the `toString` method of the `Movie` class which returns the name of the movie
4. Print the movies in the form of a list

## Things you will learn

1. Named constructors
