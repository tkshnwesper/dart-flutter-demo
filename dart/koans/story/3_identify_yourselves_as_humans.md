# 3. Identify yourselves as human

Now that the two of you have introduced yourself, you realize that you are not aliens from another planet, nor are you robots from the future, you realize that you are both humans! As a result you decide to alter your notions of what you really are.

## Steps

1. Create an `abstract` class called `Human` in the `people` folder in a file named `human.dart`.
2. Now inherit this class in both `Bob` and `Alice` classes, as you have come to a conclusion that they are both human.
3. Now push up the `greet` and `sayName` methods as well as the `name` variable to parent class.
