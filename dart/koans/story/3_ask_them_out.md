# 3. Ask them out

While conversing, you suddenly realize that you would like to get to know them even better. So summoning your courage, you decide to ask the other out.

They take a while to think about it, but don't lose hope!

Wait patiently for their reply.

Good luck!

## Steps

1. Implement a mixin called `Thinking` on the other's class.
2. If you are Alice, create a method called `askOut` in Bob's class. Do the opposite if you chose Bob.
3. Now call the mixin's method `thinkAboutIt` from the method that you just created.
