# 7. Frantic Cashier

Once you reach the cinema hall, you look for the cashier to buy tickets. There's a long queue, and when your turn finally arrives, you realize that you are going to get late for the movie. The total price is **400** Rupees.

You pay **500** Rupees because you lack change at the moment. The cashier is an old woman, and is counting the change to be paid back very slowly.

Since you are going to get late, you ask her to hurry up. She starts to panic and starts throwing small currency at you expecting you to count it as you collect it.

Count the money that you get and make sure you stop once it is **equal or exceeds** the amount to be received.

## Steps

1. Consume the `cashStream` method to receive the change and stop at the appropriate time.
