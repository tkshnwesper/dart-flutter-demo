# 2. Getting to know each other

Now that the two of you have met, you realize that you are not aliens from another planet, nor are you robots from the future, you realize that you are both humans! As a result you decide to alter your notions of what you really are.

## Steps

1. Create a class called `Human` in the `people` folder in a file named `human.dart`.
2. Now inherit this class in both `Bob` and `Alice` classes, as you have come to a conclusion that they are both human.
