# 1. Greet

You are Alice or Bob (whoever you choose will represent your character) and you are online friends who are out to meet each other for the first time.

You see one another at the decided meeting point.

To begin with, greet the other!

## Steps

1. Import whichever character you want to choose to roleplay
2. Instantiate an object of that class
3. Call `greet()` on that object
