# 1. Greet

You are Alice or Bob (whoever you choose will represent your character) and you stumble into each other online.

To begin with, greet the other!

## Steps

1. Import whichever character you want to choose to roleplay
2. Instantiate an object of that class
3. Call `greet()` on that object
