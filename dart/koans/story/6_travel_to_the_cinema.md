# 6. Travel to the cinema

The next thing you know is that you are looking for a means of transportation to the cinema where you are going to watch a movie.

There are various options from which you can choose from, but you don't want to keep your date waiting. So you decide to take the first Taxi, Bus or Auto-rickshaw that comes your way.

## Steps

1. Create a class called `ModeOfTransportation` in the `transport` folder and create a method called `travel` in it (without defining it).
2. In the classes `Bus`, `Taxi` and `AutoRickshaw` implement the `ModeOfTransportation` class that you just created.
3. Now define the `travel` method on those classes and call the private method that's present in each of those classes.
4. Change the `dynamic` return type to `ModeOfTransportation`

1. Implementing classes
2. Learning to use `Random` class
